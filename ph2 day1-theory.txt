lamda function:
--anonymous function
when we want to use function concept without using function name
there we apply concept of lambda function  

Four pillars of oops:
1.Abstraction
2.Polymorphism
3.Inheritance
4.Encapsulation

1.Abstraction:Hiding the implementation part showing what
is required for the users 
example: exe file
we can make class or method as abstract,opposite to abstract is
 concrete

2.Encapsulation:Binding data and functioninto single entity
--public:one class info can be accessed by any other class[low level data protection]
--private:can used where it is declared/no in inheritected class[medium level]
--protected:can be accesssed only where it got declared....
whichever class inherited from this class there also we can use[high level]

3.Inheritance:Base class(parent) and derived(child) class
derived class inherit properties of base class
TYPES OF INHERITANCE:
1.SINGLE INHERITANCE
2,MULTIPLE INHERITANCE
3.MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE
4.HEIRARCHIAL INHERITANCE
5.HYBRID INHERITANCE
