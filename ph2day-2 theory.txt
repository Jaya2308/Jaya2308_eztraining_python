Polymorphism:
--one item or same item used for different purposes 
TYPES:
1.OVERLOADING:
A)OPERATOR OVERLOADING
B)METHOD OVERLOADING
2.OVERRRIIDING:


#Example for operator overloading
1+2=3 in integers
'1'+'2'=12 for strings
#Methid overloading 
ex:
add(1,2)
add(a,b)
same mthod is used for different types of arguments


2.METHOD OVERRIDING:If amethod is defective or 
can't be used inside a derived class it will take it from its base class or parent class


---------------------------------DATA STRUCTURES---------------------------------
LINEAR:arrange the data in a sequential order
---ex: array,linkedlist,stack,queue,matrix
NON-LINEAR:arrange the data in a random order(no sequential)
--ex:heap,graph,binary tree,hash table

--STATIC and DYNAMIC:
1.array is static-does not give flexibility
2.dynamic-gives flexibility-linked list,stack,queue




LINKED LIST:
EX:Train
--as the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called
asmlinked list 
TYPES:
a)single linked list-singly
b)double llinked list-doubly
c)circular linked list

CREATING LINKED LIST:
STEP1:create the node 
STEP2:partition the node with 2 segments data and none
STEP3:ada value into the blank node
STEP4:mark thenode as head
STEP5:create the next node by following the above steps
STEP6:establish link between first node and the second nodE




DISPLAYING LINKED LIST:

--Traversal is required from first node till tail node in order to display existing linked list
